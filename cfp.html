        <h4>Topics</h4>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>Designing evaluation metrics</b><br>
              Proposing and/or analyzing:
                <ul>
                  <li>Metrics with <b>desirable properties</b>, e.g., high correlations with human judgments, strong in distinguishing high-quality outputs from mediocre and low-quality outputs, robust across lengths of input and output sequences, efficient to run, etc.;</li>
                  <li><b>Reference-free</b> evaluation metrics, which only require source text(s) and system predictions; </li>
                  <li><b>Cross-domain</b> metrics, which can reliably and robustly measure the quality of system outputs from heterogeneous modalities (e.g.,  image and speech), different genres (e.g., newspapers, Wikipedia articles and scientific papers) and different languages; </li>
                  <li><b>Cost-effective</b> methods for eliciting high-quality manual annotations; and</li>
                  <li>Methods and metrics for evaluating <b>interpretability and explanations</b> of NLP models</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Creating adequate evaluation data</b><br>
              Proposing new datasets or analyzing existing ones by studying their:
              <ul>
                <li><b>Coverage and diversity</b>, e.g., size of the corpus, covered phenomena, representativeness of samples, distribution of sample types, variability among data sources, eras, and genres; and</li>
                <li><b>Quality of annotations</b>, e.g., consistency of annotations, inter-rater agreement, and bias check</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Reporting correct results</b><br>
              Ensuring and reporting:
              <ul>
                <li><b>Statistics for the trustworthiness of results</b>, e.g., via appropriate significance tests, and reporting of score distributions rather than single-point estimates, to avoid chance findings;</li>
                <li><b>Reproducibility of experiments</b>, e.g., quantifying the reproducibility of papers and issuing reproducibility guidelines; and </li>
                <li><b>Comprehensive and unbiased error analyses</b> and case studies, avoiding cherry-picking and sampling bias.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>

          See reference papers <a href="reference.html" class="underline">here</a>.
        </p>

        <h4>Submission Guidelines</h4>
        <p>The workshop welcomes two types of submission -- long and short papers. Long papers may consist of up to 8 pages of content, plus unlimited pages of references. Short papers may consist of up to 4 pages of content, plus unlimited pages of references. Please follow the EMNLP 2021 formatting requirements, using <a href="https://2021.emnlp.org/call-for-papers/style-and-formatting" target="blank">the official templates provided by the main conference</a>. Final versions of both submission types will be given one additional page of content for addressing reviewers’ comments. The accepted papers will appear in the workshop proceedings.</p>

        <p>The review process is <b>double-blind</b>. Therefore, no author information should be included in the papers. Self-references that reveal the author's identity must be avoided. Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.</p>

        <p><b>The submission site (softconf) is now available at <a href="https://www.softconf.com/emnlp2021/Eval4NLP/" target="blank">https://www.softconf.com/emnlp2021/Eval4NLP/</a>.</b></p>

        <h4 id="supplementary_materials">Optional Supplementary Materials</h4>
        <p>Authors are allowed to submit (optional) supplementary materials (e.g., appendices, software, and data) to improve the reproducibility of results and/or to provide additional information that does not fit in the paper. All of the supplementary materials must be zipped into one single file (.tgz or .zip) and submitted via softconf together with the paper. However, because supplementary materials are completely optional, reviewers may or may not review or even download them. So, the submitted paper should be fully self-contained.</p>

        <h4 id="preprints">Preprints</h4>
        <p>Papers uploaded to preprint servers (e.g., ArXiv) can be submitted to the workshop. There is no deadline concerning when the papers were made publicly available. However, the version submitted to Eval4NLP must be anonymized, and we ask the authors not to update the preprints or advertise them on social media while they are under review at Eval4NLP.</p>

        <h4 id="ARR">ACL Rolling Review</h4>
        <p>This year, our workshop also welcomes submissions from <a href="https://aclrollingreview.org/" target="blank">ACL Rolling Review (ARR)</a>. Authors of any papers that are submitted to ARR before July 15, 2021 11:59pm (Anywhere on Earth) and have their reviews ready before August 24, 2021, may submit their papers and reviews to our workshop (by August 24, 2021). Details about the logistics will be announced soon</p>

        <h4 id="multiple_submission_policy">Multiple Submission Policy</h4>
        <p>Eval4NLP allows authors to submit a paper that is under review in another venue (journal, conference, or workshop) or to be submitted elsewhere during the Eval4NLP review period. However, the authors need to withdraw the paper from all other venues if they get accepted and want to publish in Eval4NLP.</p>

        <p>Note that the main EMNLP conference this year does not allow double submission to EMNLP workshops. So, papers submitted both to the main conference and EMNLP workshops (including us) will violate the multiple submission policy of the main conference. If authors would like to submit a paper under review by EMNLP to the Eval4NLP workshop, they need to withdraw their paper from EMNLP and submit it to our workshop before the workshop submission deadline -- <b>July 24, 2021</b>.</p>

        <h4>Best Paper Awards</h4>
        <p>Thanks to our generous sponsors, we will reward three prizes (at least $100 per award) to the best three paper submissions, as nominated by our program committee. Both long and short submissions will be eligible for prizes.</p>
        
        <h4 id="presenting_published_papers">Presenting Published Papers</h4>
        <p>If you want to present a paper which <b>has been published recently elsewhere</b> (such as other top-tier AI conferences) at our workshop, you may send the details of your paper (Paper title, authors, publication venue, abstract, and a link to download the paper) directly to <a href="mailto:eval4nlp@gmail.com">eval4nlp@gmail.com</a>. We will select a few high-quality and relevant papers to present at Eval4NLP. This allows such papers to gain more visibility from the workshop audience and increases the variety of the workshop program.</p>
        <p>The submission deadline for this track is <u>August 24, 2021</u> and the notification of acceptance will be sent on <u>September 3, 2021</u>. The submitted papers will be judged separately from the main track (submitted via softconf). Note that the chosen papers are considered as <b>non-archival</b> here and will <b>not</b> be included in the workshop proceedings.</p>
